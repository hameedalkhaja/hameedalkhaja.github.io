        <div class="grid-item">the 2 types of volleyball
        <p>volleyball is usually played on a pitch with solid ground to allow players to jump higher and be able to exert explosive strength to help in reaching the ball</p>
        <p>however there is another form of volleyball which does not have a solid surface to be played on, this variation of volleyball is called beach volleyball</p>
        <p>and as the name would inform you, it is played on soft sand which makes it much harder to get to the ball, and to make matters worse even though the pitch itself is smaller, you are only allowed 2 players.</p>
